You find yourself in a comical time travel mishap and end up in a peculiar scenario. You have landed in a whimsical town called "Temporopolis" where time flows at an unpredictable pace. As the town's official Time Consultant, you must write a C program to calculate the time difference between two dates given in the date-month-year format.
Your program should take two dates as input and display the time difference between them in terms of days, months, and years excluding the end date.
Assume that the first date is always before the second date. You don't need to check the validity of the dates.

Sample Input
11/10/2005
20/5/2016

Sample Output
10 years 7 months and 9 days
